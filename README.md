# Options Backtesting


This project allows you to backtest options trading strategies using Python.


**Note:** This program uses European options because stock price data from yfinance is only available once per day (end-of-day prices).

The code uses dynamic programming techniques, specifically caching, to optimize repeated calculations such as option pricing and volatility estimation. This improves performance when backtesting multiple strategies and dates.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment

Open PowerShell and run:

```
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```
.\venv\Scripts\Activate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

With the virtual environment activated, install required packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### 3. Prepare Input Files

The `inputs` folder and its files (`tickers.txt` and `dates.txt`) are already created for you.
Simply enter the stock tickers you want to test in `inputs/tickers.txt` (one per line), and the dates you want to test around in `inputs/dates.txt` (one per line, format: MM-DD-YYYY).

Example `inputs/tickers.txt`:
```
AAPL
MSFT
GOOG
```

Example `inputs/dates.txt` (MM-DD-YYYY format):
```
01-01-2023
06-01-2023
```

### 4. Run the Program

To execute the main script, run:

```
python main.py
```

All output Excel and CSV files will be saved in the `outputs` folder. These files are automatically excluded from git tracking.

## Files
- `main.py`: Entry point for running the backtesting program.
- `option_strategy_calculator.py`: Contains logic for calculating option strategies.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists required Python packages.
- `inputs/tickers.txt`: List of stock tickers to test.
- `inputs/dates.txt`: List of dates to test around.
- `outputs/`: Folder containing output Excel and CSV files generated by the program.

## Notes
- Make sure you have Python 3.7 or newer installed.
- You can modify `requirements.txt` to add more dependencies as needed.
